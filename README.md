Python/Qt5Employee Management System (PyQt5).

This is a simple desktop Employee Management System that I developed during my course studies on Python and GUI programing. It uses Python, Py Qt5 and SQLite to ensure things run smoothly.

Through this app, I am able to add, view, update and delete employee records as well as uploading profile pictures in a clean and user-friendly interface.

Features

I am able to see the employees in a list.
I can add new employees.
[TODO] I will introduce updating of information on employees.
Deletion of employees with confirmation will be added.
I will assist in uploading and showing the profile photos of employees.
The data is stored in a local SQLite database.
I will complete the development of the desktop GUI using PyQt5.

[TODO] Technologies Used

Python 3
PyQt5 (GUI)
SQLite3 (Database)
Pillow (PIL) (Image processing)
